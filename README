How to Use:

1. Generate the Parquet file
     `python -m scripts.extract_day`
- This script processes the raw data for the current day and saves it as a .parquet file in the data/ directory.


2. Peek at the data
    `python -m scripts.peek` 
- This script loads the most recent .parquet file and prints the first few rows and column names so you can verify the data.
