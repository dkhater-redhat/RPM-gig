How to Use:

1. Generate the Parquet file
     `python -m scripts.extract_day`
- This script processes the raw data for the current day and saves it as a .parquet file in the data/ directory.


2. Filter to BaseOS and AppStream Packages
    `python -m scripts.filter_to_supported_repos` 
- This script loads the most recent .parquet file and filters all BaseOS and AppStream packages from our pre-populated CSV.

3.  `python -m scripts.peek`
- This script loads the most recent .parquet file and prints the first few rows and column names so you can verify the data.
